                    <p><strong>Indemnification</strong><br>
                        You agree to indemnify or hold harmless the company, its directors, managers, senior
                        officers, interns, and workers from any costs, claims, or liabilities, which the
                        aforementioned may be subject to in connection with a) the breach of this Agreement and b)
                        your use of the services.</p>
                    <p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><br>
                        The company will not be liable for any damages, whether indirect or consequential, from the
                        use or inability to use the services (which includes, without limitation, damages for loss
                        of profits or data and/or any business interruption), whether such arises from malicious
                        code or viruses, delays in the provision of service, deletion of files or other data. In no
                        case will the company be liable to you for any claim, whether arising in contract or tort,
                        or<br>
                        for any claim made against the company by any other party.</p>
                    <p><strong>Choice of Law</strong><br>
                        This Agreement will be governed by and construed in compliance with applicable laws of the
                        United Arab Emirates. Any controversy arising in this Agreement shall be settled through the
                        Dubai International Arbitration Centre. The arbitration shall be held in the United Arab
                        Emirates, and the language of proceedings is to be in English.<br>
                        You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or the rights granted hereunder, in whole or
                        in part, without the company’s prior written consent. Any successor in interest or assignee
                        must agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You may not give anybody else
                        access to the Services, notwithstanding the foregoing. If any provision of this Agreement is
                        found to<br>
                        be not valid, the invalidity of that provision will not impact the legality of the remaining
                        terms of this Agreement.</p>
